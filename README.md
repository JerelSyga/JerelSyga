Hello, I'm Jerel Syga. I was a Navy Hospital Corpsman and now currently a Labratatory Assistant.
On my spare time I can be found in the kitchen cooking and practicing my new hobby that I've taken up is photography and videography.
I'm currently learning to program at Promineo Tech, while I've used computers for years, I have no experience in coding.
